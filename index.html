				<article>
					<p>If you have a pest problem in your home or business, you've come to the right place. We start each project with an extensive bug control evaluation, checking the floors, walls, clothes, basement, and attic for any signs of an infestation. Then we consult with you about what kind of unwelcome visitors you may have and the best way for us to handle them. We also describe what to look in the future so you can identify possible infestations before they become a problem. Then we get to work, completely removing any pests by depriving them of their fundamental necessities, like food, water, and appropriate temperatures. The earlier we treat the area, the more effective the treatment will be.</p>

				<h1 align="center">Rodent Control</h1>
				<article>
					<p>The most dangerous aspect of a rodent is the disease it can carry. Contact with an infected rodent or inhalation of its urine, feces, or saliva can lead to fever, headache, nausea, and even death. Rodents are also incredibly fast breeders, so it's important to enlist rodent control as soon as you notice one. Rodents are very good at hiding from people, so the best way to deal with them is by placing traps around the infested area. After a rodent is caught in a trap, the others will soon leave after realizing that the area is unsafe. After that, we seal any holes used to gain entry and clean the area so that no harmful bacteria is left behind.</p>
